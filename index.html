  <div class="green"><strong>The International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum</strong> is a <mark>globally recognized</mark> educational framework designed to develop students into well-rounded, inquisitive, and compassionate individuals. 
    It emphasizes critical thinking, intercultural understanding, and a strong sense of global citizenship. The curriculum is structured across <b>four</b> programs: 
    the <b><em>Primary Years Programme (PYP), Middle Years Programme (MYP), Diploma Programme (DP), and Career-related Programme (CP)</em></b>, each tailored to specific age groups from ages 3 to 19. 
    A hallmark of IB education is its emphasis on inquiry-based learning, encouraging students to ask questions, explore real-world issues, and make connections across subjects.
  In the IB Diploma Programme (DP), typically pursued in the final two years of high school, students take courses across six subject groups, including languages, sciences, mathematics, and the arts. 
  In addition to these subjects, the DP includes three core components: the Extended Essay (EE), Theory of Knowledge (TOK), and Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS). These elements foster independent research skills, philosophical 
  reflection, and meaningful community engagement. Together, the IB curriculum promotes academic rigor while nurturing students' personal growth,
   equipping them with the skills and mindset needed to succeed at university and beyond. One of the key strengths of the IB curriculum is its focus on developing students into lifelong learners who are not only knowledgeable but also open-minded, reflective, 
   and principled. IB learners are encouraged to explore different perspectives, engage in collaborative problem-solving, and communicate their ideas effectively. 
   The curriculum is intentionally international in outlook, preparing students to thrive in a rapidly changing, interconnected world. Whether through language acquisition, global issues in the classroom, or interdisciplinary projects, 
   IB students gain a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and social responsibility. This holistic approach ensures that learners grow both academically and personally, with a strong foundation for leadership and meaningful contribution to society.

<Div class="orange">Seoul Foreign School’s School‑Wide Extracurricular Program (SWEP) provides an extensive array of after-school and weekend opportunities throughout the year. 
  Students in all grade levels can choose from a diverse selection of activities in sports 
  (e.g., soccer, basketball, badminton, track & field, table tennis, wrestling), fine arts (ceramics, clay art, visual arts, music ensembles, choir, drama production), 
  and academic enrichment (robotics, chess, Model UN, math competitions, coding). These offerings change seasonally—fall, winter, and spring—to match students' evolving interests, and aim to boost confidence, social skills, and academic exploration 
  Added to this is the Saturday Sports Program (SSP), run by the PTA. It’s tailored especially for elementary and middle school students, though older students may join too. Taking advantage of the school’s top‑notch facilities, 
  SSP offers weekend sessions in soccer, basketball, baseball, <del>funk fitness</del>, fencing, and badminton—designed for skill-building, team experience, and healthy weekend engagement 
  Beyond structured sports and arts, SFS encourages academic and leadership‑focused programs that enrich the IB journey. Middle Years and Diploma students can develop deeper engagement through activities 
  like the MYP Personal Project and IB’s CAS (Creativity, Activity, Service) and Extended Essay. High schoolers can tap into clubs such as Model UN, Speech & Debate, Math and Science Olympiads, 
  Habitat for Humanity, National Honor Society, robotics, film club, and more—creating a personalized extension of their passions and study.</Div>
